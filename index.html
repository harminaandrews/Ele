  <h1> . <a href="https://elegantautos.de/">McLaren 750S 2023 Review: A Symphony of Speed and Precision
</a>.</h1>
  <p> The McLaren 750S is an intense and intoxicating supercar that rivals the Ferrari 296 GTB. Tim Pitt drives it on the road and track. And… brake, brake, brake!” There’s a hint of concern in my instructor’s voice as Curva 1 at Estoril – a third-gear right-hander – looms suddenly large at 170mph. I stamp on the middle pedal and my internal organs compress against the harness belts as F1-inspired monobloc callipers clamp onto huge ceramic discs. If anything, the way the 750S sheds speed feels even more implausible than how it gains it. My brain is struggling to keep up.</p>


<p>If this latest McLaren looks familiar, that’s because it’s a ‘30 percent new’ evolution of the existing 720S. Back in 2017, we hailed the 720S as a new benchmark supercar, but a lot has happened since then. Arch-rival Ferrari launched the plug-in hybrid 296 GTB, for starters, and there is a new electrified enemy within: the McLaren Artura. With only a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 to tax its rear tyres, chief engineer Sandy Holford describes the 750S as “a purist’s supercar”. Peak power of 750hp is 30hp more than its predecessor, thanks to forged pistons, additional boost pressure and a lighter, louder exhaust. McLaren has also shaved 30kg from the car’s weight, with a lightest dry figure of 1,277kg – nearly 200kg less than a 296 GTB.</p> 

<h2>The Unveiling: A '30 Percent New' Evolution</h2>
<p>If the McLaren 750S appears as a familiar face, it's because it's a '30 percent new' evolution of the celebrated 720S. In 2017, the 720S set a new standard for supercars, but the automotive landscape has shifted. Rival Ferrari introduced the plug-in hybrid 296 GTB, and now McLaren faces a new contender in its own lineup: the electrified Artura.
   
  <h2>Power and Performance: A Purist's Supercar</h2>
  <P>With a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 as its beating heart, the 750S stands as a purist's supercar. Sandy Holford, chief engineer, proudly emphasizes this focus. The 750hp generated by this powerhouse is a 30hp boost from its predecessor, thanks to meticulously crafted forged pistons, increased boost pressure, and a lighter, more resonant exhaust. The weight reduction is equally impressive, with the lightest dry figure at 1,277kg, nearly 200kg less than the 296 GTB.</P>

<h2>The Driving Experience: From Coupe to Spider</h2>

<P>Get yourself connected. I’ll begin by heading for hills in the 750S coupe, then drive the same challenging route in the drop-top Spider, then finish my day at Estoril.
</P>

<P>Inside the McLaren 750S, the dashboard may seem a touch dated, but its simplicity, highlighted by tactile switches, stands in stark contrast to Ferrari’s less-than-stellar haptic touchpads. The upgraded media system now offers Apple CarPlay connectivity, enhancing the overall driving experience.</P>

<h2>On the Road: Agile and Responsive</h2>
<P>Within the first few hundred yards, the 750S coupe feels more alert and intense. In middle-tier Sport mode, throttle response is voracious, and gearshifts via the paddles are brutal. The hydraulic steering, now with a quicker ratio, is remarkably precise, allowing you to navigate corners with almost telepathic precision. The beautifully damped ride of the 720S remains unspoiled, showcasing the McLaren's breadth of ability. </P>

<h2>Roofless Rapture: The 750S Spider</h2>

<P>Lean and roofless. The 750S Spider is 49kg heavier and arguably a less “purist” choice. However, its carbon fibre structure is equally rigid, and being able to retract the electric hard-top – or simply lower the vertical rear window – does really amplify that new P1-style exhaust.</P>

<p>The 750S Spider, albeit 49kg heavier, offers a unique driving experience. Its carbon fibre structure maintains rigidity, and the ability to retract the electric hard-top or lower the vertical rear window enhances the experience, especially with the resonant P1-style exhaust.</p>

<h2>Track Day Thrills: Circuit Breaker </h2>

<p>Track mode is, of course, the default setting when I strap on a helmet and Hans device, then settle into a 750S that is idling angrily in the pit lane.</p>

<p>When it comes to the track, the McLaren 750S proves its mettle. With dihedral doors cutting into the roof, climbing aboard attired in track gear is made easier. The deeply sculpted ‘Senna’ buckets provide a snug fit but require some finesse for a graceful exit. Fitted with lightly treaded Pirelli Trofeo R tyres, optimized for the track, the 750S delivers confidence and throttle-adjustability that are second-to-none.</p>

<h2>Comparisons and Choices: 750S vs. Competitors </h2>

<p>Would I choose one over a 296 GTB? Yes. While the Ferrari is a more polished package, I simply prefer how the <a href="https://elegantautos.de/">McLaren 750S drives.</a>And over an Artura? I’m not so sure. If you enjoy track days, the 750S is the weapon of choice, but the cheaper Artura is a more rounded road car.</p>


<h4>Conclusion:</h4>

<p>In the realm of supercars, choices abound. Comparing the 750S to the 296 GTB, the preference leans towards the McLaren for its driving dynamics. However, against the Artura, the decision becomes more nuanced. For track enthusiasts, the 750S stands as the weapon of choice, while the Artura offers a more balanced package for road driving.</p>
